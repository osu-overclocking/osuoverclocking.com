## Welcome one, welcome all! 

![Elmor and Skatterbencher Visit](https://cdn.osuoverclocking.com/legacy/Main_Group.webp)

We are a collective of ambitious Engineering students competing in liquid nitrogen overclocking competitions and developing custom solutions for thermal management, power draw, hardware, software, and ease of use.

Currently we are the only college in the U.S. to have a dedicated overclocking team. We have operated for 7 years, building knowledge and techniques over that time.

With a team of over 25 students we have a variety of disciplines of engineers ranging from mechanical to electronic engineering and everything in between. 

![Pie Chart](https://cdn.osuoverclocking.com/legacy/Major_Makeup.webp)

We are currently developing tools such as a controllable heated LN2 Pot, custom LN2 pots with integrated Leidenfrost reducing plates, and a custom lightweight OS. Along with that we are building show stopper pieces such as a passively cooled immersion pc cased and custom 3d printed cases. 

We currently have 25+ members actively engaging in overclocking and these projects to build their skills both for competition and for the job market. This is with an experimentalist mindset where we actively test and improve with data we have collected.
