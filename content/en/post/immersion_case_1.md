We are almost done with final dry fitting with all panels now machined out, all that's left is adding the pass through for power, USB type-c connection, and display out.

We have already ordered a 12v power supply to run 3 cables into the case to do power delivery to the CPU and GPU and to connect with a pico power supply for the 24-pin motherboard power delivery.

we have achieved the goal originally set out to be under a 2 liter volume to save on the 2 phase dielectric fluid that we are using. This has been donz by creating a unified mount for the GPU to be attached to the motherboard for a hyper compact pc with off the shelf components.

Plan on doing first filled test by next month given if the feed through's are finished.
