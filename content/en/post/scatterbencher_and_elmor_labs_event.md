On April 20th, Scatterbencher & Elmor labs came to visit and share some of their overclocking expertise!


They gave us a presentation of their framework for how to overclock, which was as such:

1) 
2) 
3) 

Needless to say, we will definitely be incorporating these strategies for our club!

After the presentation, we returned to our clubroom to overclock.

Pieter & Jon

With the very same CPU & board they had used to beat the world record clockspeed, (name & name) then demoed their process to us again. 

Alongside these, (name & name) also employed the use of (x item, y item, z item) to improve performance. This allowed us to reach (x amount of clock speed more) than our usual baseline. Additionally, this hardware allowed us to achive (x amount of score increase)- alongside being a blast, this hardware will enhance our performance immensely on HWBot.

The best part? (Sans their silicon-lottery CPU and motherboard), they gifted us all of the overclocking hardware to keep!

It was a blast having (name & name) over, and we look forward to using the knowledge we've gained from their visit to further improve our impact on the overclocking scene. Thank you again Scatterbencher & Elmor Labs!
