description: "Visited by 9.1GHz Clockspeed World Record Holders Pieter & Jon"
---

On April 20th, OSU Overclocking had the opportunity to host Scatterbencher & Elmor Labs' Pieter and Jon.

Coined "the Lebron James and Kobe Bryant of overclocking" by our club president Walker, they 100% lived up to the hype. Alongside the experience being a blast, we were able to take a lot of insight away from their experience in overclocking.

One of our most prominent takeaways from their visit was their framework for setting world-records.

Pieter and Jon shared their proven strategy for setting world records in overclocking, which they broke down into clear, actionable steps.

Following is a transcript of these steps from their presentation:

<hr>

# Step by Step Record Attempt

## 1 - LN2 Base Bios Configuration
- Apply voltages & other settings that cannot be adjusted at runtime, but which help improve cold boot bug
- CPU ratio, voltage, BCLK adjusted in OS

## 2 - Operating System Setup
- Kill all unnecessary services
- Affinity of background services to a non-target CPU core

## 3 - Overclock Setup
- Engage slow mode to force all cores to 8X
- Apply target CPU voltage
- Apply target CPU ratio to target CPU core

## 4 - Record Attempt
- Open CPU-Z
- Set CPU-Z to the target core
- Idle until CPU temperature hits predetermined target
- Release slow mode
- Press F7 to create CPU-Z validation file
- Re-engage slow mode
- Increase BCLK if system stable
- Try again

This will serve as a great reference point for both beginning and experienced overclockers in our club.

Alongside outlining their framework, Pieter and Jon also brought their 9.1GHz-world-record CPU and motherboard. Following their presentation, they set up their gear and gave a live-demo of their overclocking process.

During this demo, we saw the use of several new components: a high-end LN2 pot (to enhance thermal distribution), a heated motherboard bed (to prevent cold bug), and a custom OC panel (an all-in-one tool for general overclocking use) - all courtesy Elmore Labs.

While we didn't have any liquid helium on-hand, Pieter and Jon were still able to achieve very high clockspeeds during their demo.

After showing us their process and gear, they opened up the station to the rest of our club: our club then hosted an internal "overclocking competition" to see who could set the highest score & clockspeed on their setup. Alongside being a fun competition, it was a great opportunity for everyone in our club to solidify Pieter and Jon's overclocking framework.

 The best part: After the demo, we were *gifted* all of the gear that Pieter and Jon had used on their CPU and motherboard setup. For this, we are immensely greatful. Their custom pot, heated motherboard bed, and custom OC panel will allow us to perform much better when competing for world records.

It was a blast having Pieter and Jon over, and we look forward to seeing them again. The knowledge, experience, and insight we've gained from their visit will be used to further improve our club's impact on the competitive overclocking scene. Thank you again Scatterbencher & Elmor Labs!
