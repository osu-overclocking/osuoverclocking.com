Hi, I'm Zander I'm a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering major, I have been apart of the club for 2 years now, I focus a lot on high end desk top overclocking, which means I'm working with cpu package loads of upwards of 1.8kW. I work in a research lab doing thermal fluid science research, for the likes of the Idaho National Laboratory and Microsoft. I have worked closely with sponsors for the OC Club including the likes of Intel, ASUS, IEEE, and Micron. My goal is to give those opportunities and access to career building knowledge and skills building for students to be familiar with industry standard platforms.

## Ayden Murphy-Kirsch

**Vice-President**

Hello, my name is Ayden and I am a Junior year Electrical and Computer Engineering major. As an overclocker, I focus mainly on GPU overclocking and modification. As part of my capstone, I am designing a GPU power supply similar to the EVGA Epower card which will allow the club to set even more extreme GPU records. I currently work at the Extreme Heat Transfer Laboratory on campus where I use programming and arduino to automate testing and calibration of devices as well as design PCBs for the Microsoft and INL projects and other hardware systems. For the club, I created and maintain this current website as well as manage a significant portion of the software in the club.

## Caden DeFries

**Secretary**

My name is Caden DeFries, I’m a sophomore studying Electrical Computer Engineering and a minor in Theatre Arts. I mainly focus on CPU overclocking with a passion for single core overclocking as I currently hold the world record for single core 13900k on Cinebench R23. I’ve been with the club for a year and a half, joining almost as soon as I started my freshman year and am currently serving as the club’s secretary. I’m the main guy who teaches the basics of CPU overclocking to anybody who asks, teaching both how to do basic performance increases in BIOS and using applications and other tools while in the OS to give any newcomers a well-rounded foundation to start overclocking off of. I’m currently working as an intern in the Oregon State University’s Material Synthesis and Characterization Facility, doing general maintenance and upkeep on the clean room used for research and development. I also work as a game master for Escape Corvallis, a local escape room. In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, and playing games of all kinds, ranging from card games to video games.

## Cooper Tillson

**Treasurer**

Hello I'm Cooper, I'm a sophomore in Mechanical Engineering. I joined the overclocking club a year and a half ago and am currently the club treasurer. I have really enjoyed working on graphics cards overclocking and my custom designed pc case. Outside of the overclocking club I enjoy playing soccer and competing in alpine ski racing. I work in the Heat Transfer lab, where I'm researching using computers to heat pools. This summer I will also be working as an intern at Intel in Hillsboro.

## Ashley Bailey

**Event Coordinator**

{{< figure src="./Ashley_Bailey.webp" class="profile_img" title="Ashley Bailey" >}}

I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, where I channel my passion for engineering, which began in my hometown of Dufur, Oregon. Since joining the Overclocking Club in Fall 2023, I have dedicated myself to GPU overclocking, achieving multiple world records in the field. My commitment led to my election as the club's co-event coordinator. Beyond academics, I work in a research lab, contributing to significant projects for the National Science Foundation and smaller-scale initiatives for the Ideal National Laboratory.
