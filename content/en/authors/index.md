## Ashley Bailey

**President**

{{< figure src="./Ashley_Bailey.webp" class="profile_img" title="Ashley Bailey" >}}

I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, where I channel my passion for engineering, which began in my hometown of Dufur, Oregon. Since joining the Overclocking Club in Fall 2023, I have dedicated myself to GPU overclocking, achieving multiple world records in the field. My commitment led to my election as the club's co-event coordinator. Beyond academics, I work in a research lab, contributing to significant projects for the National Science Foundation and smaller-scale initiatives for the Ideal National Laboratory.

Hello I'm Cooper, I'm a sophomore in Mechanical Engineering. I joined the overclocking club a year and a half ago and am currently the club treasurer. I have really enjoyed working on graphics cards overclocking and my custom designed pc case. Outside of the overclocking club I enjoy playing soccer and competing in alpine ski racing. I work in the Heat Transfer lab, where I'm researching using computers to heat pools. This summer I will also be working as an intern at Intel in Hillsboro.

Hi, I'm Zander I'm a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering major, I have been apart of the club for 2 years now, I focus a lot on high end desk top overclocking, which means I'm working with cpu package loads of upwards of 1.8kW. I work in a research lab doing thermal fluid science research, for the likes of the Idaho National Laboratory and Microsoft. I have worked closely with sponsors for the OC Club including the likes of Intel, ASUS, IEEE, and Micron. My goal is to give those opportunities and access to career building knowledge and skills building for students to be familiar with industry standard platforms.
