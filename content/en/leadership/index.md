## Ashley Bailey

**President**

{{< figure src="./Ashley_Bailey.webp" class="profile_img" title="Ashley Bailey" >}}

I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University, where I channel my passion for engineering, which began in my hometown of Dufur, Oregon. Since joining the Overclocking Club in Fall 2023, I have dedicated myself to GPU overclocking, achieving multiple world records in the field. My commitment led to my election as the club's co-event coordinator. Beyond academics, I work in a research lab, contributing to significant projects for the National Science Foundation and smaller-scale initiatives for the Idaho National Laboratory.

## Donovan Burk

**Vice President**

I am currently studying Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Physics and Computer Science. I have been a part of the club for three years now going on four and enjoy the atmosphere that it brings including all our members. Outside of the overclocking club I enjoy swimming, hiking and snowboarding and am currently in the MECOP program. This summer I've been interning at Thermo Fisher Scientific. As part of the club, I hold a number of overclocking records. Last year, I was co-event coordinator for this club, and have been elected the role of vice president for this coming year.

## Cooper Tillson

**Treasurer**

Hello I'm Cooper, I'm a sophomore in Mechanical Engineering. I joined the overclocking club a year and a half ago and am currently the club treasurer. I have really enjoyed working on graphics cards overclocking and my custom designed pc case. Outside of the overclocking club I enjoy playing soccer and competing in alpine ski racing. I work in the Heat Transfer lab, where I'm researching using computers to heat pools. This summer I will also be working as an intern at Intel in Hillsboro.

 ## Alex Carroll

**Secretary**

I am a senior Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Oregon State University, I also am pursing my M.S. in Electical and Computer Engineering through an Advanced Masters Program. I joined the Overclocking club in Fall of 2022, and with the support of the club I have been able to devlop a power card for GPU's as my senior project. Through the MECOP program I have interned at both Boeing and Jacobs. 

## Zander Ray

**Competition Lead**

Hi, I'm Zander I'm a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering major, I have been apart of the club for 2 years now, I focus a lot on high end desk top overclocking, which means I'm working with cpu package loads of upwards of 1.8kW. I work in a research lab doing thermal fluid science research, for the likes of the Idaho National Laboratory and Microsoft. I have worked closely with sponsors for the OC Club including the likes of Intel, ASUS, IEEE, and Micron. My goal is to give those opportunities and access to career building knowledge and skills building for students to be familiar with industry standard platforms.
